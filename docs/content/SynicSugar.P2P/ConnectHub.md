## ConnectHub
<small>*Namespace: SynicSugar.P2P*</small>


### Description
Manage around p2p connections.<br>
This script is Singleton generated by SourceGenerator. This behaves like a network server, and SynicSugar send and receive packets through ConnectHub.<br><br>

At compile, SourceGenerator generates a ConnectHub for each assembly with variables and functions according for the Network attribute. In other words, each assembly has different ConnectHub and that instance. Usually an instance calls ConnectHub in the same assembly automatically. There is no need for us to do anything special for this.

Each assembly can have max 255 variables and functions with  Network attribute (SyncVar, RPC and TargetRPC).
